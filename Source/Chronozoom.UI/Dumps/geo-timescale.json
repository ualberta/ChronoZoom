One of the most famous Cambrian fossil sites, the Burgess Shale, can be found in Yoho National Park, in British Columbia, Canada. The site preserves an incredible diversity of soft-bodied organisms, animals that do not normally preserve because of their relatively delicate nature. Even though the site was initially found over 100 years ago, the fossils found within it are so abundant and diverse that new species are being named to this day.",

Vascular plants – that is, plants with water conducting cells – make up the vast majority of the plants that surround us today.

One of the best places in the world to find fossils of early vertebrates is a locality called Man on the Hill (or MOTH), in the Mackenzie Mountains of the Northwest Territories in Canada. These deposits include a great diversity of jawless marine vertebrates, including the spoon-headed osteostracans, and the shield-headed pteraspidomorphs. They also include early vertebrates with jaws, the 'spiny sharks' (which aren't really sharks at all) called acanthodians. Some of these specimens are helping to answer longstanding questions about the origins of teeth – did teeth arise from special cells in the throat of early vertebrates and eventually move into the jaws, or are teeth modified from the hard head scales of these early vertebrates? Research on specimens from the MOTH locality is ongoing at the University of Alberta!",

During the Devonian, however, a group of medium sized, fleshy-finned fish called sarcopterygians began inhabiting shallower and shallower waters. As these fish became better and better adapted to these shallow, oxygen poor environments, they developed the ability to breathe oxygen from the air and support their weight with their fins. These adaptations that made them good shallow water predators also allowed them to start moving on land, possibly allowing them to move between isolated ponds or to prey on early terrestrial arthropods. <em>Tiktaalik</em> roseae represents one of these stages, as it possesses strong, limb-like fins and may have had air-breathing lungs. <em>Tiktaalik</em> was found in 2004 on Ellesmere Island, in the Canadian Arctic.

The top of a turtle shell, called the carapace, is formed from the ribcage; as a turtle embryo develops, the ribs expand outward until the entire back is covered by bone, with the hips and shoulders actually inside the ribs. The earliest turtle with a shell, <em>Proganochelys</em>, would have looked a lot like the turtles you see today. Go back a little bit further in time and you find an animal called <em>Odontochelys</em>, which had a complete belly shell (called a plastron) but only a partial carapace – there were gaps between the wide ribs. The origin of turtles, and where turtles fit on the amniote tree of life, is still contentious, but recent research suggests that the ancestors of turtles may be traced back into the Permian.",

Snakes evolved during the mid-Cretaceous, but most groups represented by living species did not evolve until after the End-Cretaceous extinction. The giant extinct marine reptiles called mosasaurs are also squamates – they were lizards that returned to the sea and evolved adaptations for a marine lifestyle like paddle-like limbs and a streamlined body. The earliest mosasaurs also evolved during the mid-Cretaceous, but went extinct along with the dinosaurs at the End-Cretaceous extinction.

During his fieldwork in 1910, he located a site full of the bones of a large theropod dinosaur, bones that would later be identified as <em>Albertosaurus</em>. Despite the abundance of bones found there, the site was largely ignored for decades, and it wasn't until University of Alberta palaeontologist Phil Currie (then working for the Royal Tyrrell Museum) and his colleagues rediscovered the site in 1999 that it became more widely known. Since the rediscovery, the site has yielded bones from over 26 individual <em>Albertosaurus</em> skeletons. Although we may never be absolutely certain, the evidence from this bonebed along with other bonebeds containing large theropods strongly suggest that tyrannosaurs were gregarious and social animals on at least some level.",

During the late 19th Century, entire railroad cars filled with fossils were being shipped to the large museums in the eastern U.S. for study by the palaeontologists O.C. Marsh and E.D. Cope. Today, palaeontologists are still working these fossil fields, regularly discovering new localities and new species.",

In the southern US, as with most other regions during the Triassic, dinosaurs were relatively small and somewhat uncommon animals. Triassic dinosaurs were typically outnumbered and outweighed by their larger archosaur cousins and by the large herbivorous synapsids, like the tusked <em>Placerias</em> in the image here. It would take several million more years, and the extinction of many competitors at the end of the Triassic, before dinosaurs would diversify in both number and shape, coming to dominate terrestrial ecosystems during the Jurassic and Cretaceous.",

Shortly after this, about 3.46 billion years ago, structures called stromatolites appeared, bacterial mounds that can still be found today in some isolated, hypersaline (extremely salty) bays. However, these fossils are relatively complex, and so life would have actually first began earlier than this. We do have chemical traces of life, in the form of organic derived carbon, in rocks from 3.8 billion years ago. However, the further and further back in time we go, the fewer rocks there are to study, and so finding fossil evidence becomes less and less likely.",
